## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project analyzes and models customer response behavior to a financial product â€” the "N/LAB Platinum Deposit." Using a real-world styled dataset from N/LAB Enterprises, the goal is to improve telemarketing strategy through advanced data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

- Removed columns with >50% missing or unknown values (e.g., `poutcome`)
- Dropped rows with missing target labels (`y`)
- Detected and removed outliers using IQR and z-score methods
- Engineered interaction features: `balance_duration_ratio`, `call_efficiency`
- Standard scaling applied to numerical features
- Removed non-informative or constant features

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Call Duration**: Most significant predictor of subscription success (correlation ~0.47)
- **Account Balance**: Higher balances â†’ higher likelihood of subscription
- **Age**: Older individuals (especially >70) had higher conversion rates
- **Class Imbalance**: 88% "No", 12% "Yes" â†’ tackled with evaluation focus on specificity and accuracy

## ðŸ§  Models and Evaluation

| Model              | Accuracy | Specificity | Precision |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 83.52%   | 97.03%      | 69.09%    |
| Decision Tree       | 82.82%   | 95.80%      | 62.50%    |
| Random Forest       | 81.41%   | 94.58%      | 54.41%    |

- **Logistic Regression**: Best precision, strong for reducing unnecessary calls  
- **Random Forest**: Best for identifying more potential subscribers  
- **Decision Tree**: Clear interpretability, useful for strategy and targeting

## ðŸ“Œ Key Business Recommendations

1. **Prioritize longer calls** â€“ Duration strongly correlates with conversions  
2. **Optimize call efficiency** â€“ Longer, more efficient calls are effective  
3. **Target age groups 30â€“50** â€“ Best response rates  
4. **Focus on high-balance customers** â€“ Greater interest in investment products  
5. **Use cellular contact** â€“ Better engagement compared to other methods  
6. **Refine messaging scripts** â€“ Based on age, balance, and call length  
7. **Deprioritize low-conversion groups** â€“ e.g., unemployed, blue-collar roles  
8. **Tailor offers to financial status** â€“ E.g., no housing loan = more receptive
